# Easy-Comment

 This is a tiny Python program that adds comment section to the top of the source file.
 The only dependency is latest version of Python(V 3.6.2)
 It works for C. However, I will add the other languages.

### Usage
   Open a terminal:
```
	$ cd ~/Desktop
	$ git clone https://github.com/almerion/easy-comment.git
	$ cd easy-comment
	$ python3 create-comment.py
```
